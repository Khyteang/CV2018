## Computer Vision Final Project 2018
 This repo includes a final report, survey paper, final presentation, and the source code for the proposed algorithm. This project is based on the Kaggle's 2018 Data Science Bowl challenge which is to design an algorithm that can efficiently and accurately segmenting cell's nuclei in microscopic images. The proposed approach for this challenge is to use the convolutional network known as U-Net to train the model.
